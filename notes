# Barycentric coordinations


# Linear interpolation -

Many libraries and shading languages have a "lerp" helper-function (in GLSL
known instead as mix), returning an interpolation between two inputs (v0, v1)
for a parameter t in the closed unit interval [0, 1]. Signatures between lerp
	functions are variously implemented in both the forms (v0, v1, t) and
	(t, v0, v1).

// Imprecise method, which does not guarantee v = v1 when t = 1, due to floating-point arithmetic error.
// This method is monotonic. This form may be used when the hardware has a native fused multiply-add instruction.

float lerp(float v0, float v1, float t)
{
    return v0 + t * (v1 - v0);
}

// Precise method, which guarantees v = v1 when t = 1. This method is monotonic only when v0 * v1 < 0.
// Lerping between same values might not produce the same value

float lerp(float v0, float v1, float t)
{
    return (1 - t) * v0 + t * v1;
}

This lerp function is commonly used for alpha blending (the parameter "t"
is the "alpha value"), and the formula may be extended to blend multiple
components of a vector (such as spatial x, y, z axes or r, g, b colour
components) in parallel.
